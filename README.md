# Bamazon!
A project I completed during the University Of Denver Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. This app has two functions, one functions as a Terminal Inteface that allows "Customers" To make purchases, and second allows a "Bamazon Manager" to query the database to update, view low inventory, and add products. Enjoy!
## Getting Started
This app can be run in Terminal/Bash. It includes a Package.json file which you can download to run the app locally. As an alternative, you will find a link below to a video of the app in action!
